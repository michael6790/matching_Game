JavaScript Matching Game
This was the final project for my 4 week Nucamp bootcamp. It was supposed to be a matching game with a smiley face picture. I replaced the image with a baby Yoda image, changed the CSS to have a custom apparance, and created a button to change the background to a forrest image from star wars to make the baby Yoda image blend in more and be a bit more difficult.
